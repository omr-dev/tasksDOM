    <p><strong>React</strong> (also known as <strong>React.js</strong> or <strong>ReactJS</strong>) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building
        user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of
        individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page,
        mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with
        state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
        additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.[7]</p>
